# bank_prediction
The dataset contains data on some Pilgrim Bank customers in the years 1999 and 2000.

The purpose of this work is to predict which customers are about to leave the bank. To do this, the main classification algorithms will be used to predict whether a customer from 1999 will still be a customer in 2000 or not.
